## Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aneela, a Front-End Developer
Since 2020 I've living and breathing web development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces. I've had the chance to immerce myself in many different works and projects, helping to make internet a beautiful place.
I'm always trying to learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm coding, listening to podcasts.
